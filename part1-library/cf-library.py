'''
Use object-oriented Python to model a public library (w/ three classes: Library,
Shelf, & Book). *  

The library should be aware of a number of shelves. Each shelf should know what
books it contains. Make the book object have "enshelf" and "unshelf" methods that
control what shelf the book is sitting on. The library should have a method to
report all books it contains. Note: this should *not* be a Django (or any other)
app - just a single file with three classes (plus commands at the bottom showing
it works) is all that is needed.
